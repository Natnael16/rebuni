## Description
Rebuni is a mobile application designed to address the common hesitancy in asking questions to religious leaders. It provides a safe and anonymous platform specifically tailored for individuals to ask and receive answers regarding the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. By utilizing this platform, users can freely inquire about religious practices and beliefs, creating an environment that encourages knowledge-sharing and communal learning.

## User Stories
Safe and Anonymous Questioning: As a new user exploring the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, I can post questions anonymously through this platform without any reservations or fear of judgment. This anonymity also extends to users who may lack access to religious leaders or comfortable venues for seeking answers. It allows them to gather knowledge about the religion in a secure and non-judgmental environment.

 Sharing Knowledge and Guiding Others: As a user well-versed in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, I have the opportunity to impart my knowledge to others who seek guidance or answers. By actively participating in the platform, I can respond to user questions, provide accurate information, and contribute to a community of individuals eager to enhance their understanding of the religion.
